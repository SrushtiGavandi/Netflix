# Netflix Data Analysis üìä

This project analyzes the **Netflix Titles Dataset** to explore trends, content types, release years, and more using **MySQL**.

üé• **Video Inspiration**: [YouTube Project Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/-7cT0651_lw?si=kfefcAtdG1XCSEN4)

> **Note**: Though this project is inspired by the YouTube video, the implementation differs as **MySQL** was used instead of **PostgreSQL**, which leads to differences in query syntax and format. Additionally, a few **self-made questions** were included in the analysis.

- **Source**: Kaggle / Open Source
- **Columns**: Show ID, Title, Director, Cast, Country, Date Added, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Type, Genre
